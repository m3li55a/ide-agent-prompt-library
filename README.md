# Enhanced IDE Agent Prompt Library

Welcome to the **Enhanced IDE Agent Prompt Library**, a comprehensive collection of actionable, neutral prompts designed to optimize codebases through IDE agents or orchestration tools. These prompts cover security, code quality, UI/UX, architecture, testing, performance, documentation, and more, aligned with industry standards such as OWASP Top Ten 2021, WCAG 2.2, DORA metrics, and Clean Code principles. 

## Purpose
This library provides developers, DevSecOps engineers, and AI-assisted coding tools with structured prompts to:
- Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
- Improve code quality, maintainability, and performance.
- Standardize UI/UX and ensure accessibility.
- Optimize CI/CD pipelines, APIs, databases, and observability.
- Streamline documentation and internationalization.

Prompts are designed to be language and framework agnostic, making them adaptable to any codebase.

## Features
- Modular prompts for:
  - Autocompleting agents
  - Code refactoring both
  - Documentation generators
- IDE-specific guidance
- Inspired by real-world AI integrations

## Repository Structure

**/prompts**: Individual Markdown files for each category (e.g., `security.md`, `code-quality.md`).

**/examples**: Sample code snippets and configurations for prompt implementations (e.g., secure logging, OpenAPI schemas).

**CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing new prompts or improvements.

**CHANGELOG.md**: Version history of the library.

**LICENSE**: MIT License for open usage.

## Categories and Prompts
The library is organized into categories addressing security, Devops, observability, UX, technical writing and compliance.  The IDE prompts cite specific frameworks and industry best practices, and more will be added in the future to address vendor-specific services.
