## Aligned with OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk best practices.

# Dependency Health and Security Update

As a Senior DevOps Engineer, analyze dependencies for outdated, deprecated, or vulnerable components using OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk. Remove unused dependencies, update to latest secure versions, and suggest alternatives for deprecated libraries. Ensure updates are non-breaking via compatibility checks. Provide updated configuration files (e.g., package.json, pom.xml).

# Broken Link and Reference Repair

Scan code, comments, documentation, and configurations for broken internal/external links using tools like Lychee. Update or remove outdated references. Provide a report of changes and validation steps.

# Dependency License Compliance

Review dependencies for licensing issues (e.g., GPL, MIT conflicts) using tools like FOSSA or ScanCode. Flag incompatible or restrictive licenses. Recommend compliant alternatives and update dependency manifests with justifications.
