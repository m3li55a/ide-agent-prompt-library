# AI Code Review Integration

Review the codebase for AI-generated code (e.g., via Copilot, CodeWhisperer) to ensure quality, security, and adherence to project standards. Refer to Github Copilot best practices and refactor suboptimal patterns and document improvements.

# AI-Prompt Engineering for IDE Tasks

Optimize prompts for AI-assisted IDE tasks (e.g., code completion, refactoring suggestions). Provide examples of effective prompts for common development tasks and review previous prompts to identify ways to further automate mundane tasks. 

# AI-Assisted Test Generation

Use AI tools to generate unit and integration tests for uncovered code paths. Validate generated tests for accuracy and coverage. Provide test code and integration steps.

## Aligned with emerging AI coding tools and GitHub Copilot best practices.
