Provide code snippets and highlight exemplary designs.

# Sleek E-Commerce Product Page

Design a product page with interactive galleries, spacious layouts, smooth animations, and prominent checkout buttons. Optimize for mobile and accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels). Provide sample code.

# Interactive Onboarding Experience

Develop an onboarding flow with tooltips, animated transitions, illustrations, and progress indicators per Nielsen’s heuristics. Ensure accessibility and localization support. Provide code examples.

# Responsive Analytics Dashboard

Create an analytics dashboard with dynamic charts (e.g., Chart.js), responsive layouts, and interactive filters. Optimize for performance and accessibility. Provide chart configurations and code.

#Modern Profile and Settings Interface

Design a profile/settings page with card layouts, customizable avatars, toggle switches, and micro-interactions. Ensure WCAG compliance and responsiveness. Provide code snippets.

# Dark Mode and Theme Switching

Implement a dark mode toggle with user preference persistence (e.g., localStorage, CSS custom properties). Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards. Provide CSS and JavaScript examples.
