## Aligned with Googleâ€™s Core Web Vitals, DORA metrics, and CNCF performance guidelines.

# Performance Audit and Optimization

Act as a performance engineer. Profile the codebase for bottlenecks (e.g., slow queries, CPU-intensive loops) using tools like New Relic or Chrome DevTools. Optimize with caching (e.g., Redis), lazy loading, and efficient algorithms. Ensure Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms). Document changes with performance metrics.

# Resource Efficiency Optimization

Analyze memory, CPU, and I/O usage for leaks or inefficiencies (e.g., unclosed connections). Optimize with connection pooling, garbage collection tuning, or data structure improvements. Provide annotated code examples.

# Scalability Design Enhancement

Assess architecture for scalability per CNCF guidelines. Identify single points of failure or stateful services. Refactor for stateless designs, distributed systems (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), or auto-scaling. Provide implementation guidance.

# Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

Evaluate code for energy efficiency (e.g., excessive polling, redundant computations) per Green Software Foundation principles. Optimize loops, reduce API calls, and use efficient data formats (e.g., Protobuf). Provide metrics on energy savings.
