# Localization Support Implementation
Add support for multiple locales with translation files and language-switching mechanisms. Test for RTL languages (e.g., Arabic) and locale-specific formats. Provide code snippets.

# Regional Customization

Enhance adaptability for time zones, measurement units, and cultural preferences. Implement configurable options with defaults. Provide examples for dynamic locale handling.
