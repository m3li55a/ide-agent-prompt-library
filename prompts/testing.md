## Aligned with ISTQB standards and TDD/BDD methodologies.

# Comprehensive Test Suite Enhancement

Act as a QA lead following ISTQB principles. Review unit, integration, end-to-end, and regression tests for gaps. Aim for >80% coverage (industry benchmark). Refactor tests for isolation, mocking (e.g., Jest, Mockito), and clarity. Implement missing tests for critical paths. Provide test code and coverage reports.

# Test Framework Standardization and Automation

Standardize testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Pytest) and runners for consistency. Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions). Optimize for speed with parallel execution. Highlight high-coverage areas as examples.

# Mocking and Stubbing Optimization

Refactor tests to use mocks, stubs, or fakes for external dependencies (e.g., APIs, databases) to ensure isolation. Use libraries like WireMock or Sinon. Provide examples for reliable, fast tests.

# Performance Testing Integration

Implement performance tests for load, stress, and scalability using tools like JMeter or k6. Define benchmarks (e.g., <200ms response time under 1000 users). Provide test scripts and integration steps.
