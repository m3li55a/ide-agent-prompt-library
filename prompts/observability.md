# Observability Framework Integration

Act as a monitoring and observability specialist implement metrics, traces, and logs using OpenTelemetry or Prometheus. Track performance, errors, and user behavior. Provide setup examples for tools like Grafana.

# Error Monitoring and Alerting

Enhance error handling with monitoring integrations (e.g., Sentry, Datadog). Set up alerts for critical errors (e.g., 5xx responses). Provide configuration and dashboard examples.

# Distributed Tracing Implementation

Add tracing for multi-service architectures using Jaeger or Zipkin. Implement spans and propagation for request tracking. Provide setup code and examples.

# Real-Time Log Aggregation

Provide a detail data flow to implement centralized logging with ELK Stack or Loki for real-time analysis. Ensure secure log storage and filtering for sensitive data using industry standards for encryption and access methods. Provide configuration scripts that include references to any industry standard used to generate this data flow.

##Aligned with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and ELK Stack best practices.
