## Aligned with OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect, and NIST 800-63B.

# Social Authentication Integration

As an Identity and Access Management Administrator, integrate social authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) using OAuth 2.1. Include secure registration, ID/secret management, and callback handling. Provide server-side and client-side code snippets.

# Front-End Authentication UI Components

Create consistent front-end components for social authentication with branded buttons, error handling, and theme alignment. Ensure accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels). Provide React/Vue/HTML examples.

# Back-End Authentication Handling

Implement server-side authentication with token verification (e.g., JWT), profile retrieval, and session management. Integrate with existing user flows. Provide code for frameworks like Express or Django.

# Secure Authentication Pipeline

As an security engineer specializing in OWASP Application Security Verification Standards, establish a secure authentication flow with token refresh, secure cookies, and CSRF protection. Prevent vulnerabilities like session fixation. Provide configuration examples.

# Authentication UI/UX Consistency.

Design authentication screens (login, signup, MFA) with consistent styling, transitions, and error messaging. Align with the appâ€™s design system. Provide CSS and component code.

# Authentication Dependency Management

Identify and configure secure authentication libraries (e.g., Auth0, Passport.js). Document setup, usage, and security settings with code snippets.

# Authentication Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for authentication failures, expired tokens, and access denials. Provide user-friendly messages and logging. Include code examples.

# Authentication Test Suite

As an application pentesting engineer, develop test cases for authentication flows (success, failure, edge cases) using industry standard frameworks. Ensure coverage of MFA, token refresh, and session expiry. Provide test code.
