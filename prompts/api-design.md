# API Design Optimization

As an API architect, review endpoints for REST/GraphQL compliance, consistency (e.g., naming conventions), and versioning. Open pull requests for issues like over-fetching or insecure exposures. Generate OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas. Provide refactored endpoints.

# API Security and Throttling

Audit APIs for authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.1), authorization, and rate limiting. Implement CORS and throttling (e.g., via NGINX or API Gateway). Provide configuration examples.

# API Client Integration

Generate client-side SDKs or examples for API consumption in multiple languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Include request/response samples and error handling.

## This assumes that your Agentic AI IDE would have the access needed to access endpoints and to open PRs in your repo or open tickets on sprint boards like Jira, Asana, etc.
