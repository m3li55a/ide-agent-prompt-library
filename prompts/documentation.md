# Documentation Best Practices and Standardization

Act as a technical writer following IEEE 26515. Review README, inline comments, and API docs for completeness and clarity. Update with consistent formats (e.g., Markdown, JSDoc). Add setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting. Apply changes directly.

# API Documentation Automation

Generate OpenAPI 3.1-compliant documentation for public APIs, including endpoints, parameters, responses, and error codes. Integrate with tools like Swagger or Redoc. Provide client-side consumption examples.

# Onboarding and Contribution Guides

Enhance README and onboarding docs with project overviews, installation steps, contribution guidelines, and architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML). Ensure clarity for new developers.

# Knowledge Base for Incident Response

Create a knowledge base for common issues, error codes, and resolutions. Include runbooks for incident response and debugging guides. Format in Markdown or Confluence-compatible structure.
