# Accessibility Compliance Audit

Act as an accessibility specialist. Audit UI for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, checking for missing alt text, low contrast (<4.5:1), keyboard navigation issues, and ARIA role gaps. Implement fixes with code snippets. Highlight compliant components as best practices.

# Inclusive Design Enhancement

Review for inclusivity (color-blind friendly palettes, scalable fonts, multilingual hints). Refactor for cultural sensitivity and universal design. Provide CSS examples and testing steps.

# Automated Accessibility Testing

Integrate accessibility tests (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) into CI/CD pipelines. Test for screen reader compatibility and focus management. Provide test code and setup instructions.
